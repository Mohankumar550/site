🔧 Create an immersive, modern portfolio website for Mohankumar Palanisamy, a creative and award-winning software engineer. The theme is "Walking Through My Journey" — where visitors scroll or click through the timeline of his career as if they are walking alongside his growth.

🌟 Core Concept:
Use a horizontal or vertical timeline animation with smooth walk-through transitions.

As the user scrolls, the avatar or silhouette of Mohankumar (or a line/dot/character) “walks” along a timeline path.

Each milestone (job, award, project) appears with motion effects, e.g., slide-in cards, fading badges, glowing tags.

🔥 Sections as Milestones (Scrollable + Animated):
Landing Scene: "👋 Hi, I'm Mohankumar P" – with subtle ambient animation (stars, tech circuits, etc.)

Show headline: “Engineer. Problem Solver. Creative Technologist.”

CTA button: “🚶‍♂️ Walk My Journey”

Milestone Cards (as scroll or timeline animation):
